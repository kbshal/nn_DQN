# Artificial Neural Network and Deep Q-Learning Network from Scratch

Implementation of a Neural Network (MLP) and Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) using only the numpy library. The DQN is trained to play the Cartpole game.

## Multilayered Perceptron (ANN)

### Neural Network Construction: [Notebook](nn-mlp_from_scratch.ipynb)

This notebook provides a step-by-step procedure for constructing a multilayered perceptron.

### Neural Network Implementation: [NeuralNetwork](nn.py)

This file contains the full implementation of the neural network, with added momentum to the weight updating step. To save and load the `NeuralNetwork`, use `save_network` and `load_network` from [saveload.py](saveload.py).

## Deep Q-Learning Network

### Train DQN to Play Cartpole: [Notebook](dqn_from_scratch.ipynb)

This notebook demonstrates how to use the `NeuralNetwork` to implement the DQN algorithm.
